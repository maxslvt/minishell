**      commands that end up never executing (e.g. the losing side
**      of a failed && chain)

** t_hd bundles everything process_all_heredocs needs (the tree
** root for recursion, env/status for $VAR expansion inside heredoc
** bodies, and the original line for reference) into one struct so
** it can be passed around without a long parameter list.
